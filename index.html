  <!--ABOUT-ME-->
  <div class="box" id="AM">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="information">I am currently in my second year studying BSc (Hons) Cyber Security at RGU, Aberdeen. This follows on from studying HND Computing Science at UHI Inverness which allowed me to experience a wide range of areas of computing, and Web Design Fundamentals on day release at UHI Moray during S6 at High  School. From my first year here at RGU and the HND, I now have a broad range of knowledge and it has helped me to discover the areas that interest me and establish my strengths.</p>
    <p class="information">I have particular interest in security and design and enjoy the challenge of design and development. From the range of topics studied, I find my strengths lie in forensics, databases and web development. The course has allowed me to develop skills in self-motivation/self-study, team working and project management. It has also helped extend my IT knowledge in both software and hardware and recognise the importance of timescales, meeting deadlines and priorities. </p>
      <p class="information">I am creative and enjoy designing and drawing and can come up with individual concepts. </p>

    <h2>Hobbies & Achievements</h2>
      <p class="information">Winner of the the Conoco Phillips award for my first year of studies at RGU for outstanding achievement. </p>
      <p class="information">During my 6 years at High School, I was awarded 12 annual school awards for various subject and achievemnts. This includes being the vice house captain for Mackintosh where I spear-headed new challenges for the house cup that were based on creative skills instead of the usual sporting challenges. I was also a member of the Events & Fundraising committees. </p>
      <p class="information">In 2012 I was awarded first prize at the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://morayfairtrade.org/">PrintIT! Awards</a> in London for one of my designs in Graphic Communication - Best Graph category</p>
      
      <p class="information">I am a keen dancer, currently attending ballroom dancing classes but have also done Salsa, and been a member of an Irish dance troupe.</p>
      <p class="information">I am creative and took a bookmaking course during Summer 2018. Using what I learned, I entered a local <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/2FTceYK">textiles competition</a> where I won first place in the accessory category. I also enjoy making jewellery out of wire and beads. In 2014 I was lucky enough to have one of my pieces displayed in an exhibition at the Elgin Galllery, situated in the library. </p>
